<h2 class="smcap">Annals of the War.</h2>


<p>In preparing the following paper, it
has been my desire only to record what
its title suggests&mdash;personal reminiscences.</p>

<p>Leaving to other and abler pens the
task of writing an accurate history of
the scenes and events to which reference
is now about to be made, I shall confine
myself simply to the task of setting down
such things as came under my personal
observation, or within the scope of my
individual knowledge.</p>

<p>I do this the more confidently, remembering
the marked interest that invariably
attaches to the testimony of an eyewitness,
and also bearing in mind (for
my own comfort) that this interest will
always incline his hearers to leniency in
judging literary demerits. It is probable,
too, that some of my old comrades will
be pleased at this recurrence to an eventful
period in their lives, while a younger
generation in the ranks may be glad to
have placed before them a record, not of
the &ldquo;pomp and circumstance of glorious
war,&rdquo; but of its privations, its hardships,
its perils, and, it may be added, its lessons
of self-abnegation and of devotion to
duty.</p>

<p>Early in the month of July, 1863,
while stationed very comfortably at the
Isle of Hope, a courier, &ldquo;spurring in hot
haste,&rdquo; brought orders from Department
headquarters that set our camp at once
in a turmoil of eager and excited preparation.
The 32d Georgia, Col. George P.
Harrison, Jr., the 12th and 18th Georgia
Battalions, Lieut.-Col. H.&nbsp;D. Capers and
Major W.&nbsp;S. Basinger, and a battalion
from the First Volunteer Regiment of
Georgia, were ordered to proceed with
the least possible delay to Savannah, there
to take cars for Charleston.</p>

<p>A private note at the same time
brought the intelligence that that city,
so long threatened, and, indeed, once already
assailed by sea, was now to undergo
a vigorous and combined attack from
both land and naval forces. The day
was an eventful one to us without this
additional stimulant. In the morning
we had received the sad news of the fall
of Vicksburg and the consequent opening
of the Mississippi river to the Federal
fleet, from the mountains to the sea,
a disaster that secured to the enemy the
grand object of his most strenuous exertions,
while it severed the young Confederacy
in twain and deprived our armies
east of the river of all the aid and
comfort in the way of material supplies
and gallant recruits, that had been so long
and so freely drawn from the west bank.
We had just learned, too, of the check
received by General Lee at the battle of
Gettysburg, and now came the summons
to tell that our turn had come for a little
squeeze in the folds of the traditional
&ldquo;Anaconda,&rdquo; that the New York <i>Herald</i>
had so graphically depicted as encircling
the South.</p>

<p>The men received the orders with enthusiasm&mdash;indeed,
when was it otherwise
with the Southern soldier.
Thoroughly conversant, as they all were,
with the details of the war, they could
not but be depressed by the news of such
grave reverses to our arms as the morning&rsquo;s
mail had brought them, and they
gladly welcomed the relief that active
service promised from the tedium of
camp life, and the necessity of thinking
upon melancholy subjects.</p>

<p>Our march began in the midst of a terrific
thunder-storm that had the effect,
not only of cooling down any overplus
of excitement, but also of rendering the
road to the city almost a quagmire
throughout its entire length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
There are pleasanter ways of spending
a summer&rsquo;s evening than in trudging
for eight miles, through mud and rain, in
heavy marching order; but upon this, as
on similar occasions during the war, I
was deeply impressed by the uncomplaining
patience and cheerfulness with
which the men endured hardships that
few would care to face now, but which,
then, were regarded as mere matters of
course&mdash;distasteful, certainly&mdash;but not
worth talking about.</p>

<p>The storm delayed our march considerably,
and upon reaching the depot we
found that the 32d Regiment, which had
been stationed at a point nearer the city,
had already taken train for Charleston.</p>

<p>We, too, were soon <i>en route</i>, and early
in the forenoon of the following day&mdash;July
10, 1863&mdash;the three battalions were
safely in bivouac at the terminus of the
Savannah and Charleston Railroad.
Here we were met by a staff officer, who
informed us that we were to reinforce
the garrison of Battery Wagner, on Morris
Island, and that at dusk the necessary
transportation would be furnished to
take us down to the fort. He also told
us that the enemy, under cover of a tremendous
fire of artillery, from batteries
on Folly Island, which had been unmasked
during the night, had effected a
lodgment on the south end of Morris
Island, and had driven our forces back
upon &ldquo;Wagner,&rdquo; which fortification
would, doubtless, be attacked on the
next day. We learned, also, that another
force was threatening James Island, and
that the 32d had been sent, with other
troops, to meet that danger. Events
proved that this last was a feint, to distract
attention from the main attack.</p>

<p>All day we remained quietly at this
place, endeavoring to make out the various
points of interest in the beautiful
harbor spread before us, and watching
the little clouds of smoke that ascended
from the parapets of Fort Sumter, as its
guns were slowly fired at the enemy. It
was a lovely day, clear and bright, without
a cloud in the sky. The vegetation
about us, freshened by the rain of the
previous evening, added sweet odors to
the soft sea-breeze that came up the bay.
Upon our left the city of Charleston &ldquo;sat
like a queen,&rdquo; her roof tops and spires
glittering in the sunlight, while afar
down, over an expanse of shining water,
could be seen the ships of the fleet
swinging lazily at their anchors.</p>

<p>The picture was beautiful, and for one
I would have found it difficult to realize
that beneath it all were the grim front
and iron hand of war, but for the dull
rumble of the constantly recurring shot
from Sumter. That was &ldquo;the fly in the
ointment of the apothecary;&rdquo; that &ldquo;the
spectre at the feast;&rdquo; that the refrain
ever ringing in our ears and suggesting
the unwelcome thought&mdash;&ldquo;it looks peaceful
enough now, but just wait until tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About nightfall we embarked in a
steamer that had been sent for us, and,
after many delays, were safely landed at
Cumming&rsquo;s Point, on the northern end
of Morris Island. The line was formed
at once, and we set out for Battery Wagner,
reporting to its commander, Col.
Graham, of the 21st South Carolina Regiment,
at about 11 o&rsquo;clock at night.</p>

<p>At the risk of being somewhat tedious,
I must here devote a few lines to the topography
of this famous island. It is a
long, narrow strip of sand, running almost
due north and south for about four
miles, varying in breadth from, say one
hundred yards at the narrowest point to
half a mile at the broadest. Upon the
west side the island is separated from
James Island by Vincent&rsquo;s creek and by
broad marshes intersected by numerous
salt water creeks, while its eastern shore
is washed throughout its entire length
by the waters of the Atlantic Ocean. At
the south end were the batteries from
which our troops had been driven in the
morning. Light House Inlet separated
this point from Folly Island, and across
this inlet the enemy had suddenly thrown
their forces, under cover of a furious
fire of artillery, as has already been
stated. At the northern extremity of the
island, known as Cumming&rsquo;s Point, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
located Battery Gregg, and about three
quarters of a mile to the south of this,
Battery Wagner stretched entirely across
the island from the sea on the left to Vincent&rsquo;s
creek on the right, the battery
facing due south. It was an irregular
work. On the extreme left a heavy traverse
and curtain protected the sally
port and gave a flanking fire down the
beach to any force that might assail the
main work. Then came a salient, one
face of which commanded the ship channel,
then a broken line, arranged for
flanking fires, extending to the marsh.
The parapets were solid, and a broad,
deep, dry moat added boldness to their
profile. Within the parade were bomb-proofs
and lightly constructed barracks
for the small garrison that had heretofore
occupied the work. The armament consisted
of one 10 inch Columbiad and
some 32-pounders in the sea face, and
four or five lighter guns, chiefly howitzers,
on the land side. A short distance
in front of the right of the line an inward
bend of Vincent&rsquo;s creek narrowed
the island in such manner as to render it
obligatory upon an attacking force to deliver
its assault only against the left half
of the fort, and also affording scant opportunity
for the deployment of such a
column. In point of fact this peculiar
feature in the topography proved of
great service to us, and correspondingly
troublesome to the enemy in the operations
that followed. The surface of the
island is but little raised above the level
of the sea and presents a glaring stretch
of white sandy hillocks, which were
sparsely dotted with the coarse grasses
of the coast, and which changed their
contour in every high wind.</p>

<p>There is but to add that the main
channel by which ships enter Charleston
harbor runs within easy gunshot of
Morris Island from one end of it to the
other, then crosses to the northward and
passes between Fort Moultrie on Sullivan&rsquo;s
Island, and Fort Sumter, built
upon a shoal about midway between the
two islands.</p>

<p>From this rapid sketch, reference being
had to the map, it will be readily appreciated
that from the base held by the
enemy, a <em>front</em> attack upon Charleston
could begin here and nowhere else; and
that, as the defences of the inner harbor
were at that time imperfect, the immediate
fall of Wagner would gravely impair
the safety of Charleston also. But
that little mound of sand had its history
to make, a story that will ever bring a
flush of honest pride to the face of every
man who participated in the long defence.</p>

<p>As soon as we had reported to Colonel
Graham, the troops were put into position,
the 18th Battalion in the salient, the
12th upon its right, and the 1st Georgia
on the left, occupying the flanking curtain
and the sea face, to which allusion
has been made. The guns were all
manned by South Carolina artillery and
the right and centre of the fort were
held by infantry from the same State.
The men were cautioned that an attack
was expected at daylight, and then, tired
out, they slept on their arms upon the
ramp, ready at a moment&rsquo;s call for action.
Captain C. Werner, of the German Volunteers,
was appointed officer of the
night, and in a few minutes every sound
was hushed save the swash of the waves
upon the beach, and the occasional challenge
of a sentinel from his post.</p>

<p>My own resting place was upon the
parapet, and looking up to the cloudless
heavens above the solemn glory of the
night impressed itself upon my last
waking thoughts.</p>

<p>At the first peep of dawn, on the 11th,
we were wakened by a few straggling
shots in our front, followed by a ringing
cheer and three distinct volleys of musketry
from our picket line. The anticipated
assault was upon us. In an instant,
the garrison was aroused, and as the men
had slept in position they had only to
spring to their feet, and we were ready.
Now we could see our pickets, their duty
having been faithfully performed, retiring
rapidly towards our right, in accordance
with the instructions they had
received, so as to uncover the advancing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
columns of the enemy. And, then,
through the dim, gray light of the morning
we could distinguish a dark, blue
mass of men moving up the beach towards
us, at the double quick, cheering
as they came.</p>

<p>Then came the thunder of our first
gun (what old soldier is there who does
not recall <em>its</em> startling effect), then another
and another, then the deafening rattle of
small arms, mingled with yells and cheers,
and we were fairly in the midst of battle.
The issue was never doubtful for a moment.
The attacking column attempted
to deploy after passing the narrow neck
in front, but entirely failed to do so;
while the dense formation rendered it an
easy mark for both infantry and artillery.
Still it pressed gallantly on, and some
few of the foremost men reached the
scarp of the work, only to find themselves
unsupported by their comrades, and with
no other alternative than to yield themselves
prisoners. One brave fellow I
saw, however, who had not the thought
of yielding in him. Alone he reached
the top of the parapet, immediately in
front of a 32-pounder, double charged
with grape shot. The officer in command
(Lieutenant Gilchrist, of South
Carolina, if memory serves me,) struck
by his bearing, called to him to come in
before the gun was fired. His only reply
was to put his musket to his shoulder,
and a bullet whizzed by Gilchrist&rsquo;s head.
The explosion of the gun followed, and
a blue and mangled body, all that remained
of a brave man and a good soldier,
was hurled across the ditch.</p>

<p>The engagement was of short duration;
the attack had failed, and soon the
broken column was in full retreat, rapidly,
and without any semblance of order,
leaving some hundreds of their
number, stretched dead and wounded on
the sands, or prisoners in the fort.</p>

<p>Our own loss was insignificant in numbers,
but the 1st Regiment was sorely bereaved
in the death of Captain Werner.
This gallant officer was slain early in the
fight. He died in the discharge of duty,
nobly battling for the land of his
adoption. His voice, calling his comrades to
arms, had been the first to greet our ears
as the morning broke, and now it was
hushed forever. Modest, simple, and
unpretending in his manners, he had won
a warm place in the affections of the
command, while his perfect reliability
under all circumstances enforced the respect
and admiration of all who knew
him. Savannah was called upon to
mourn the loss of many sons in those
terrible years, but none of them had
taken up arms in her defense sooner,
none suffered privation and imprisonment
for her more patiently, and none died
more gallantly than Claus Werner.</p>

<p>The loss in the 18th Georgia was heavier
than in any other organization, as it
had occupied the salient, against which
the assault was principally directed.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Frederick Tupper was severely
wounded, and among the killed
was young Edward Postell, who now
sleeps in Laurel Grove, side by side with
a noble brother, who, like himself, as the
marble record testifies, &ldquo;died in battle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Immediately after the action, a singular
instance of the ups and downs and
uncertainties of warfare, was brought to
our attention. Among the first troops
to enter Fort Pulaski, at its capture in the
previous year, was the 7th Connecticut
Regiment, then commanded by Colonel
Alfred H. Terry (subsequently Major-General).
Both officers and men had behaved
towards us with great kindness
during the few days that we remained at
the fort after its capture, and we had become
personally acquainted with quite a
number of them. <em>Now</em>, we were the
victors, and among the prisoners brought
in at our end of the line, were many of
our old friends of the 7th Connecticut,
who recognized and called us by name.</p>

<p>The news of the attack created much
excitement in Charleston, and during the
morning many visitors, both military and
civilian, came to the island, some to assure
themselves of the continued strength
of our position; others to gratify a pardonable
curiosity. Among the former
was Brig. Gen. Ripley, the district
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
commander, who was much elated at the
successful issue of the fight, and who
wished to examine, personally, the
ground in front of the fort.</p>

<p>Now, at one point in our front, torpedoes
had been planted the day before,
and to prevent any of the garrison from
treading upon them, a sentinel was placed
to warn them off. At that time the man
who held this post was Private Donnolly,
of Company G, 1st Georgia, a native of
the Emerald Isle, as his name would indicate,
and a true son of his mother. Of
any knowledge of ordinary military man&oelig;uvres
he was calmly innocent. On
one occasion a Lieutenant of the company
asked him, impatiently:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Donnolly, why <em>don&rsquo;t</em> you keep step?
All the men are complaining about you.&rdquo;
And received the reply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith, its divil a one of &rsquo;em can kape
shtep wid me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Past this hero General Ripley spurred
his horse, and was riding straight for the
dangerous ground, when he was suddenly
brought to a halt by a loud
&ldquo;Shtop!&rdquo; uttered in the most emphatic
tone, and the emphasis receiving additional
point from Donnolly&rsquo;s attitude, as
he stood with his musket at full cock, at
the shoulder, and squinted along the
barrel, taking dead aim at the General.
For a moment there was strong probability
of a vacancy among the Brigadiers
of the Confederate army, but an
officer rushed forward, struck up the
gun, and explained to General Ripley
the reason for his being halted.</p>

<p>Subsequently, our sentinel was asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Donnolly, what were you going to
do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going to shot him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To kape him from being blown up
with the saltpaters, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Donnolly&rsquo;s comrades, in view of his
little infirmities of drill, had always insisted
upon his having a place in the rear
rank, but on this day he was heard to say,
with much satisfaction:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s moighty little throuble getting
in the front rank now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our experience for the next week was
a trying one. Failing in the direct attack,
the enemy&rsquo;s endeavor seemed to be
to make our berth uncomfortably warm,
and here the success was undoubted.
Day after day the monitors&mdash;some four
or five in number&mdash;and that tremendous
war vessel, the &ldquo;New Ironsides,&rdquo; would
take their positions directly opposite the
fort, at a distance of six to eight hundred
yards, the wooden ships being at
much longer range. Then would be
poured in upon us a steady stream of
shot and shell, much more pleasant to
dwell upon as a memory than it was to
endure, while upon the land side new
batteries were built by the enemy, and
each day the weight of metal thrown
against us would seem to be heavier than
the day before. I well remember the
approach of the first monitor. How deliberate
its movements; how insignificant
its appearance; the deck almost
level with the water, and the little black
turret giving small promise of its hidden
power for attack. My curiosity about
the vessel was great, but was soon to be
satisfied without stint. There was a slow
revolving motion of the turret, a cloud
of smoke, a deafening roar, and then,
with the rush and noise of an express
train, the huge fifteen inch shell, visible
at every point of its trajectory, passed
over head and burst far in the rear. The
next shell exploded in the parapet, covering
several of us with dirt. The introduction
was complete. Thenceforward
we held these singular looking
craft in wholesome respect. The &ldquo;Ironsides,&rdquo;
however, was probably the most
formidable ship of the fleet. She is said
to have carried at bow and stern two
hundred pound Parrott guns, and nine
eleven-inch Dahlgrens on a side. Her
broadsides were not fired in volley, but
gun after gun, in rapid succession, the
effect upon those who were at the wrong
end of the guns being exceedingly demoralizing.
Whenever she commenced
there was a painful uncertainty as to
what might happen before she got
through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
We had but one gun with which to
fight the monitors&mdash;the ten-inch Columbiad
located just over the sally-port.
True, the thirty-twos were tried for a
while, but they were so impotent to harm
the heavy mail of the ships that their
use was soon discontinued. This Columbiad
was manned, I think, by the
Matthew&rsquo;s Artillery, of South Carolina,
and the gunner, Frazer Matthews, was as
noble a soldier as the siege produced. In
the midst of the hottest fire he would
stand quietly on the chassis directing the
aiming of the gun with all the coolness
and precision of target practice. Never
flurried, always intent upon the work
before him, and never giving the signal
to fire until the aim was taken to his entire
satisfaction, the accuracy of his
marksmanship was great. Again and
again I saw the solid ten-inch shot strike
upon the sides of the monitors, only to
break into a thousand fragments, that
would splash into the sea like so much
grape-shot.</p>

<p>At first we thought that no harm was
done by our fire, but we learned afterwards
that the concussion within the turret was
tremendous, and that, among others, one
very prominent officer had been killed
by it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, our Columbiad was
soon dismounted, and although a new
carriage was supplied, that, too, was
knocked to pieces in short order. Indeed,
this experience was repeated half a dozen
times.</p>

<p>Such continuous cannonading of
course seriously impaired the integrity
of our parapets. But as at that stage of
the siege the firing ceased at nightfall,
opportunity was given to repair damages,
and all night long the garrison would
work, filling sand bags and painfully endeavoring
to make good the yawning
chasms and ragged craters left by the
terrible missiles that had been hurled into
the fort during the day. There was a constant
strain upon all the faculties, that
gave little time for anything save the
stern duties of the hour, and yet there
were humorous incidents ever occurring
that even now will bring smiles to the
lips of all who remember them.</p>

<p>Who can forget &ldquo;Aquarius,&rdquo; the water
bearer, as he was dubbed&mdash;a simple-hearted
fellow, from the back woods of
South Carolina, who devoted his time to
bringing water to the wounded. Both
heels of his shoes were carried away by
a shell, and from that time he went barefooted&mdash;there
was &ldquo;danger in shoes,&rdquo; he
said. And, then, the simple manner in
which, on returning from one of his
trips to the well, he held up one full jug
and only the handle of another, saying,
apologetically, &ldquo;Oh, a shell took hit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I can see in my mind&rsquo;s eye, too, the
brilliant engineering feat of a member of
the Oglethorpe Light Infantry, who,
while cooking a little dinner in the open
parade, provided protection for himself
by placing an empty flour barrel alongside
of the fire, and gravely sticking his
head into it whenever the scream of a
shell warned him of approaching trouble.</p>

<p>During the week General Taliaferro,
of Virginia, assumed command, and on
the night of the 17th fresh troops were
sent to relieve us&mdash;and it may be mentioned
here, that this plan of changing
commanders, and the garrison (or at least
a part of it), every few days, was continued
throughout the siege. In fact, the
strain upon body and mind was so unremitting,
that a week&rsquo;s tour of duty was
about as much as any men could undergo
at a time, as there was no rest day
nor night.</p>

<p>We were landed at Fort Johnson, on
James Island, a little before dawn on the
18th, and were just getting comfortably
settled in the village then existing at that
point, when a tremendous cannonading
began against the fort we had just left.
All day long it continued, exceeding
in fierceness and rapidity anything we
had yet witnessed. The noise was terrific,
great clouds of smoke hung over
the devoted battery, and huge columns
of sand rose high in the air, as shell after
shell rent the parapets, while only an occasional
shot in return gave any sign that
there was life left in the garrison. With
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
mingled feelings we watched the bombardment,
full of anxiety for the ultimate
result, and for the safety of our
comrades in the fort, there was, also, it
must be confessed, a profound complacency
at the thought that we were well
out of it ourselves.</p>

<p>A little before dusk the firing suddenly
ceased on the part of the enemy, and almost
instantaneously a rapid succession
of guns from Sumter, trained for the
beach of Morris Island, gave notice that
another attempt was to be made to throw
a column into Wagner by escalade.</p>

<p>It was even so. General Gillmore,
fully alive to the difficulties which the
topographical features of the ground
presented for regular approaches, and
counting with reason upon the damaging
effect of the awful bombardment, both
upon the work itself and the &ldquo;morale&rdquo;
of the garrison, had determined to make
one more effort to wrest the position
from the Confederates by storm. To
this end he had organized a strong column
of two brigades (a third brigade
being held in reserve), under command of
General Seymour, the formation being
made behind the sand hills. Its advance
was supported by light batteries, and as
the heavy firing ceased, it swept forward
with a rush. An officer, who was in
Wagner, told me on the following day
that the assault came very near meeting
with perfect success, for, although it was
anticipated, the awful artillery fire had
compelled the garrison to seek shelter in
the bomb-proofs. The exits from these
places were narrow, and there was much
trouble in getting the men to the ramparts
in time to repel the onslaught. As
it was, the result was long doubtful. A
part of the enemy&rsquo;s column effected a
lodgment in the salient on the left, and
not until reinforcements were sent down
from James Island to the assistance of
the garrison, were these assailants finally
overpowered and the entire fort once
more in the hands of the Confederates.</p>

<p>The attack was bloody and disastrous
to the attacking force. Its leader, General
Seymour, was dangerously wounded,
and General Strong, with many of his
best officers, and hundreds of the men,
were killed, while the total loss in killed,
wounded and prisoners, has been variously
estimated at from 1,500 to 2,200
men. Nearly all of the enemy&rsquo;s regiments
were in a state of disorganization,
and gloom and dismay settled upon them.</p>

<p>In this connection it will be of interest
to state that, during the siege, the Federal
signal book was in our possession,
having been captured on the person of a
signal officer, near Georgetown, South
Carolina. Its valuable secrets had been
drawn from him by a Confederate who
shared his place of imprisonment in the
garb of a Federal prisoner. More than
once the knowledge thus acquired
proved of essential service to us. On
this occasion, the following dispatch
from General Gillmore to Admiral Dahlgren
had been intercepted, and in General
Beauregard&rsquo;s possession hours before
the assault: &ldquo;Continue the bombardment
throughout the day; at sunset
redouble it. The assault will commence
at seven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this disaster, General
Gillmore, with great tenacity of purpose
worthy of admiration, gave no evidence
of having been diverted from his objective
point. Though apparently convinced
of the futility of all efforts at a <i>coup de
main</i>, he at once settled down into an endeavor
to reduce Wagner by parallels
and trenches. Time was necessary to do
this, however, and time was the salvation
of Charleston, for upon <em>our</em> side the distinguished
officer who commanded the
department, General Beauregard, was
not idle, and nothing was left undone
for the defence, not only of the outworks,
but of the inner harbor, and of adjacent
islands and inlets. The batteries on Sullivan&rsquo;s
Island were strengthened, heavy
additions were made to the armament of
Sumter, new batteries were constructed
within the city limits and upon the
shores of James Island; some to command
the ship channel, and others to deliver
a flanking fire, though at a long distance,
upon the enemy&rsquo;s works on Morris
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
Island, while every device that the highest
engineering skill could suggest, was
gallantly acted upon by the garrison of
Wagner to prolong its defence and retard
its fall to the latest possible moment.
Torpedoes and submarine batteries
were placed in the waters of the harbor
also, and, although I did not learn that
one of them was ever exploded, there
can be no doubt that they exerted a great
moral effect, and deterred the vessels of
the fleet from prowling around where
we did not want them.</p>

<p>On the night of the 22d of July our
second tour of duty at Wagner began.
We found General Taliaferro still in
command, and the garrison increased to
about 1,500 men&mdash;though changes were
so constantly being made that, without
reference to statistical reports, I will not
pretend to accuracy on this point. On
every hand could be seen evidences of
the severe trial through which the fort
had already passed and was daily called
upon to endure. The barracks and
store houses were in ruins, and all of
the slopes and inclines, upon which the
eye of the engineer had loved to rest, were
ploughed up in huge furrows, or pitted
with cavernous holes that marked the
bursting place of shells. But sand has
many advantages over masonry, and
wherever during the day the injuries
done had impaired the defensive powers
of the fort, a thousand busy workers
would bend their energies, and the morning
light would show guns remounted,
parapets repaired and a strong front still
presented to the enemy. On the 24th of
July the bombardment was unusually severe.
The iron-clads, having nothing in
Wagner to oppose them (for on that day
our 10-inch gun was useless), came in as
close as the channel would permit,
shortly after daylight, and in conjunction
with the land batteries poured in an awful
fire upon us for hours, while from
our side, Moultrie, Sumter, Gregg, and
the batteries on James Island, Johnson,
Haskell, and Cheves, joined in the fray.
It was certainly a sublime yet terrible
sight, never to be forgotten by any who
witnessed it. The impact of tremendous
missiles, followed by the roar of their
explosion, shook the solid earth, and the
loud thunder of the guns seemed to rival
the artillery of the heavens as its unceasing
reverberations smote upon the ear.</p>

<p>Grave doubts were entertained as to the
ability of our fort to stand much longer
this dreadful storm, but help came.
About noon the steamer Alice (that had
recently run the blockade), under command
of Colonel Edward C. Anderson,
of this city, came rapidly down the harbor
from Charleston, bearing a white
flag, and laden, as we learned, with a
large number of Federal wounded, who
were to be exchanged for Confederate
wounded. She steered directly for a
position between the fleet and Wagner.
One shot was fired over her, but in a
moment the cannonading ceased, and
never was relief more welcome or more
needed.</p>

<p>Serious injury had been done to
Wagner, injury, indeed, that a short
continuance of the firing might have
rendered irremediable, as upon inspection
it was found that there remained
but about eighteen inches of sand as a
covering for the logs, of which our main
service magazine was built. One shell
had carried away the air-flue and the
flame, as it burst, had lit up the interior
of the magazine, very much to the dismay
of the men who were serving there,
and who came tumbling out head over
heels&mdash;evidently not standing on the order
of their coming&mdash;only desiring to
come quickly.</p>

<p>Colonel Anderson, in speaking of this
occurrence, tells me that as he came
down the bay, the gravity of our position
was fully realized by him, and his
determination formed to pursue the
course he did in order to bring the firing
to an end as soon as possible. He was
warned off as he drew near the fleet,
and a shell fired over him, but paid no
attention to the warning, and succeeded
in what he aimed to do. It was the right
thing done at the right time, and, as a
member of the garrison, I beg to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
here my acknowledgments of the service
performed.</p>

<p>The bombardment was not renewed
that day, and during the afternoon General
Taliaferro worked to such good purpose
that nightfall found the principal
damages substantially repaired.</p>

<p>On this occasion was brought to my
attention a striking instance of the fact
that a lofty heroism and nobility of soul
may exist where an ordinary observer
would never expect to find them. In the
ranks of Company K, of the 1st Georgia,
was a man from Bulloch county. Before
his enlistment, a charcoal burner; he
was of mean exterior, sickly frame and
complaining disposition. He had long
been a butt for the rough witticisms of
his comrades, and more than once came
to me for redress. What troubled him
most was that the men told him he had
been &ldquo;dug-up,&rdquo; an implication upon the
manner of his entry into the world&mdash;that
he resented bitterly. During the bombardment
of this day he had, in the performance
of customary guard duty, been
posted at the rampart, near the flag staff,
to watch for any movements of the
enemy that might indicate the formation
of an assaulting column. At the end of
his tour, Lieutenant Cyrus Carter started
from the guard quarters to relieve him.
Carter told me that as he crossed the
parade, he did so with the profound conviction
that he would be struck down
before reaching the other side, so appalling
was the storm of projectiles that
tore up the ground around him. What
was his surprise, therefore, to find the
sentinel, not sheltered behind the parapet,
as it was intended he should be, but
quietly walking back and forth upon its
very crest, for the expressed reason that
he &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t see good down thar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The flag staff had been shattered at
his side, and with a strip torn from his
shirt, he had tied the colors to the
stump and continued his walk. As may
be well supposed our charcoal burner
escaped criticism after that.</p>

<p>From this time forward the works of
the enemy were pushed forward most
assiduously. One parallel after another
was opened and breaching batteries established,
armed with heavy sea coast
mortars and rifle guns of tremendous
size and power.</p>

<p>On our part, corresponding exertions
were made. A heavy fire from our howitzers
and other guns was maintained;
sharp-shooters, armed with Whitworth
rifles, kept unremitting watch upon the
movements of the enemy, and a well
placed line of rifle-pits, two or three hundred
yards in our front, gave additional
strength to our position and seriously annoyed
the besiegers. There were two
sides to the matter of sharp-shooting,
however, and the loss of some brave officers
and men, killed by bullets fired at a
thousand yards distance, or more,
warned us against anything like heedless
exposure.</p>

<p>The discomforts and privations to
which the garrison was subjected rapidly
increased, and soon attained proportions
that will be remembered by those
who endured them, like the details of
some horrible dream. To avoid an unnecessary
loss of life, the men were kept
as much as possible within the bomb-proofs
during the day time; but the gun
squads and riflemen, of course, were constantly
exposed, as well as numbers who
could find no room in the shelters, or who
preferred taking the fresh air, with all
its attendant hazards. From these there
were constant additions to the list of our
losses. The wounded (and the wounds
were mostly of a terrible character), were
all brought in among the men, and the
surgical operations were performed in the
midst of the crowd, by the light of candles,
that dimly burned in the heavy air
from which all vitality had been
drawn. The cries of these poor sufferers,
the unceasing roar of artillery above and
around, the loss of rest, the want of pure
air, and the baking heat of a Southern
summer, all combined to render the position
almost unbearable. The enemy&rsquo;s
dead from the two assaults had been
buried immediately in front of the moat;
those from our garrison just back of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
fort. From the description of the island
it will be understood that shallow graves
only could be given&mdash;graves from which
a high wind would blow the light, sandy
soil, or which a bursting shell would rend,
exposing the bodies to the sunshine. The
whole air was tainted with corruption,
and finally the little wells, from which
our supply of water was drawn, became
so foul, from the same cause, that their
use was abandoned, and thenceforward
drinking water was sent from the city of
Charleston.</p>

<p>Now began a most remarkable feature
of the siege, and one that has marked a
new era in the science of attack and imposed
new and startling problems upon
the military engineer charged with the
construction of permanent fortifications.
I allude, of course, to the battering down
of the walls of Fort Sumter from a distance
of two and a half miles. The
power of rifled guns against masonry
had been conclusively demonstrated during
the previous year at Fort Pulaski.
There, however, the breaching batteries
were distant about one mile, but there were
few who could believe that at more than
twice that range Sumter was seriously
endangered. It had been thought that
the grand old fort was safe so long as
Wagner held out. But one morning a
new battery opened; the shot and shell
went high above our heads, and were
hurled with irresistible power against the
walls of Sumter. Great masses of masonry
from the outer wall fell as each shot
struck, and ere many days it seemed as
though nought but a pile of ruins would
mark the spot. Here, however, General
Beauregard gave splendid evidence of
his readiness to meet emergencies, and
of his skill as an engineer.</p>

<p>As soon as it became evident that the
fort must yield to the power of the heavy
artillery brought to bear upon it, he rapidly
withdrew all the guns that could be
utilized for defensive purposes at other
points, and from the very ruins of Sumter,
constructed, as it were, a new fortification,
fully adequate to the purpose of
commanding the ship channel to the city.
But all other power of the fort was gone,
and in the subsequent events on Morris
Island, Sumter took no part. This bombardment
lasted for seven days, and in
that time a first class masonry fort was
reduced to a shapeless ruin from batteries
located at points far beyond the remotest
distance at which any engineer
had ever dreamed of danger. The debris
of the walls fell in a natural slope
and served as an impenetrable protection
to the lower casemates of the channel
face, in which the new battery was
placed. Some little time elapsed, however,
before these changes were completed,
and I am unable to understand
why Admiral Dahlgren did not meanwhile
avail himself of the opening thus
offered and push with his iron-clads for
the inner harbor. We certainly looked
for such a dash, and General Gillmore
was evidently chagrined at the fact that
it was not made. Whether or not such
a course would have been successful is
problematical. There can be no doubt,
though, that it would have added grave
complications to the Confederate military
position, to say the least of it.</p>

<p>At such time as the 1st Regiment was
not on duty at Wagner, it was posted at
Fort Johnson, the point of James Island
nearest to Morris Island. For a time our
comrades of the 12th and 18th Battalions
shared this post with us, but as the season
progressed, we were separated; the
12th going to Sumter and other points,
and the 18th to Fort Moultrie, where it
performed months of arduous and trying
service.</p>

<p>At Fort Johnson, which, up to that
time had possessed no special strength,
very heavy works were constructed,
having reference not only to the inner
harbor, but also to the operations of the
enemy on Morris Island. These batteries,
as well as the others along the shores
of James Island, proved very annoying
to the enemy, and the accuracy of their
fire is mentioned more than once in
his reports.</p>

<p>A most interesting feature in this summer&rsquo;s
operations was the development of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
the attacking power of movable torpedoes.
Special interest attaches to a
boat that was brought from Mobile, by
railroad, and which was generally known,
from its shape, as the &ldquo;Cigar Boat.&rdquo; Its
history is linked with deeds of the loftiest
heroism and devotion of self to the
service of country. The story is familiar
to all of us, yet I cannot refrain from repeating
it.</p>

<p>This boat was one day made fast to
the wharf at Fort Johnson, preparatory
to an expedition against the fleet, and
taking advantage of the opportunity, I
examined it critically. It was built of
boiler iron, about thirty feet in length,
with a breadth of beam of four feet by
a vertical depth of six feet, the figures
being approximate only. Access to the
interior was had by two man-holes in the
upper part, covered by hinged caps, into
which were let bull&rsquo;s eyes of heavy glass,
and through these the steersman looked
in guiding the motions of the craft. The
boat floated with these caps raised only a
foot or so above the level of the water.
The motive power was a propeller, to be
worked by hand of the crew, cranks
being provided in the shaft for that purpose.
Upon each side of the exterior
were horizontal vanes, or wings, that
could be adjusted at any angle from the
interior. When it was intended that the
boat should go on an even keel, whether
on the surface or under, these vanes were
kept level. If it was desired to go below
the water, say, for instance, at an angle of
ten degrees, the vanes were fixed at that
angle and the propeller worked. The
resistance of the water against the vanes
would then carry the boat under. A reversal
of this method would bring it to
the surface again. A tube of mercury
was arranged to mark the depth of
descent. It had been the design of the
inventor to approach near to an enemy,
then to submerge the boat and pass under
the ship to be attacked, towing a floating
torpedo to be exploded by means of electricity
as soon as it touched the keel. Insufficient
depth of water in the harbor
prevented this manner of using the boat,
however, and so she was rigged with a
long spar at the bow, to which a torpedo
was attached, to be fired by actual concussion
with the object to be destroyed.
This change necessarily made the boat
more unwieldy, and probably had something
to do with the tragic circumstances
of her after history.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that she was
sunk at the wharf at Port Johnson by
the waves from a passing steamer, while a
part of the crew were in her. Days
elapsed before she could be raised. The
dead were removed, and a second crew
volunteered. They made repeated and
successful experiments in the harbor, but
finally they, too, went down and, from
some unknown cause, failed to come up.
Once more a long time passed before the
boat was raised, and then the poor remains
of the devoted crew were taken
from her in an indescribable condition.
Yet, still another set of men came forward
and volunteered for the duty.
Surely love of country and courage of
the sublimest type never found better exponents
than these. The expedition
started, but did not return. That night
the sloop-of-war, &ldquo;Housatonic,&rdquo; was reported
as having been sunk by a torpedo
in the lower harbor, but of the gallant
men who had thus accomplished what
they aimed to do, nothing definite was
ever known until after the war, when
divers, in endeavoring to raise the Housatonic,
discovered the cigar boat with
the bleached bones of her crew lying
near the wreck of the noble ship that she
had destroyed.</p>

<p>The line of rifle pits in front of Wagner
had been gallantly held by our men
during the siege, and had sorely troubled
the besiegers. On the 21st of August an
infantry force attempted the capture of
these pits, without success. On the afternoon
of the 26th, a heavy artillery fire
was brought to bear upon them without
dislodging the holders, but that night a
dashing charge of the 24th Massachusetts
Regiment gained the position, capturing
most of the Confederates who held it,
about seventy men. General Gillmore&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
fifth and last parallel was at once established
on the ground thus won, and before
dawn on the 27th, under cover of the
flying sap, the trenches were pushed about
one hundred yards nearer to the fort.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this success, General
Gillmore, in his report, speaks of this
period as &ldquo;the dark and gloomy days
of the siege,&rdquo; and of the progress made
as &ldquo;discouragingly slow, and even painfully
uncertain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ground between his front and
Wagner was thickly studded with torpedoes,
his left flank was searched by the
unremitting fire from our batteries on
James Island. The head of the sap was
slowly pushed forward under the ceaseless
fire of howitzers and sharp-shooters
from the entire front of the fort, while
last, though not least, the besiegers had
now reached a point where every onward
step compelled them to dig through the
bodies of their dead, who had been
buried some weeks before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the emergency,&rdquo; General Gillmore
availed himself of his superior resources
in artillery, to keep down the active resistance
of Wagner, and to this end
every gun ashore and afloat was turned
upon it. The final bombardment began
at daybreak on the 5th of September
and for forty-two hours continued with
a severity and awful terror beyond the
power of words to describe. That night,
as witnessed from Fort Johnson, where
the 1st Regiment were stationed, the
scene was grand in the extreme. The
lurid flushes of the guns, their unceasing
roar, the shells from every description of
tremendous artillery, that could be
tracked through the air by flaming fuses;
the mortar shell rising in stately curve
and steady sweep, the Parrott shell darting
like lightning in its mission of death,
the missiles from the fleet booming along
the water and bursting in Wagner with
cruel accuracy, the glare of calcium
lights, bringing out every detail of our
works as in the noonday&mdash;all these
filled the souls of Confederate spectators
with awe, and found their painful
antithesis in&mdash;<em>the silence of Wagner</em>. The
end had come.</p>

<p>All through the 6th the bombardment
continued, and that evening the sap had
reached the counter scarp of the work,
and only the ditch and parapet separated
the combatants. The assault was ordered
for nine o&rsquo;clock on the morning of
the 7th, but by midnight on the 6th the
place was evacuated by the Confederates,
the whole force being taken off
the island in row boats. Some few of
these boats were intercepted, but the
garrison, as a garrison, was saved. The
enemy at once occupied both Wagner
and Gregg, and Morris Island, in its entirety,
was in their possession.</p>

<p>So ended the siege of Battery Wagner,
after a defense of fifty-seven days: a defense
that may, without question, be
said to have saved Charleston. The outwork
was taken, but the inner citadel
still proudly stood. Still from the ruins
of Sumter, still from historic Moultrie,
still from the &ldquo;City by the Sea,&rdquo; the
Southern Cross fluttered in the breezes
of the bay and bade defiance to the foe.</p>

<p>The evacuation so successfully accomplished,
in the face of so many difficulties,
under so terrible a fire, and with the
enemy in such close proximity, has justly
been considered a remarkable event
and the crowning glory of the defense.
That had been protracted to the latest
moment, and when resistance was no
longer possible, the brave garrison was
saved to add fresh lustre to the Southern
arms on many another field.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 8th of September,
notice was received by the commanders
of batteries within range of
Sumter, that a boat attack would be
made upon that fortification during the
night, and they were ordered at a given
signal to open with all their guns upon
the point where the boats were expected.
The signals of the enemy had again been
interpreted, and upon our side there was
perfect readiness. The garrison of Sumter
prepared to meet the enemy upon the
slope with a shower of musketry. The
guns of our contiguous batteries were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
carefully trained upon the right spot before
dark, and as soon as night had fallen,
a Confederate ironclad moved into
position to add the fire of her powerful
guns. Silently the night wore on;
for hours not a sound broke its stillness;
the men sat drowsily by the guns, and
the belief gained ground that the proposed
attack had been abandoned, when
suddenly there was a twinkle of a
musket from Sumter, then a rocket
soared in the air, and then the bellowing
thunder of the great guns and the explosion
of shells instantaneously and startlingly
contrasted with the sleepy quiet of
our long hours of watching. The assault
was repulsed with considerable
loss to the assailants, but with no loss to
the garrison.</p>

<p>It is singular to note from General
Gillmore&rsquo;s report, as an evidence of a
want of harmony between the land and
naval forces, that two independent expeditions
were organized for this attack&mdash;one
by Admiral Dahlgren, the other
by General Gillmore. The report says:
&ldquo;The only arrangement for concert of
action between the two parties, that
were finally made, were intended simply
to prevent accident or collision between
them. Each party was deemed in itself
sufficiently strong for the object in
view.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The naval expedition, consisting of
some twenty-five or thirty boats, came
directly from the ships, in tow of steam
tugs, and, reaching Sumter first, at once
delivered its attack. The land forces,
about 400 strong, embarked in their
boats in Vincent&rsquo;s creek. The windings
of the creek probably delayed them, and
they had not quite reached the fort when
the naval assault was made and repulsed.
All hope of a surprise being at an end,
the second force retired.</p>

<p>From this time the active operations
for the reduction of Charleston upon
this line virtually ceased, though an interchange
of artillery fire was continued
with more or less activity for many
months. Not until Sherman&rsquo;s great army
swept through South Carolina, and the
dying days of the Confederacy were at
hand, did the proud city bow her head,
and yield to the inevitable.</p>

<p>Mr. President, my story is told. It has
been my endeavor to place graphically
before this audience a sketch of some of
the scenes of that eventful summer.
They have passed into history, but history
fails to record a thousand little details
which breathe life into the picture.
Some of these I have tried to present.</p>

<p>Certainly no period of the war was
more fruitful in dramatic incident, and
in no portion of the Confederacy was
there a grander exhibition of scientific
warfare. The wonderful developments
of engineering skill, both in the attack
and in the defense, will ever mark the
siege as a most memorable one, while
the share of success attained by each
side robs the memory of the event of any
sting of mortification for Federal and
Confederate alike. Sure am I that every
member of the First Georgia who participated
in these stirring scenes will, to
his latest day, feel his heart throb with
pride in saying, &ldquo;I was at Charleston in
1863.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Savannah</span>, March, 1879.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Referring to the action of Col. Anderson, related on page <a href="#Page_10">10</a>, it is proper to state that the
steamer Alice was sent out from Charleston <em>in conformity to an explicit arrangement that had been entered
into by the commanding Generals for an exchange of wounded on that day</em>.</p>

<p>She carried a &ldquo;hospital flag,&rdquo; as well as the ordinary flag of truce. Soon after the firing ceased,
she was met by the Federal steamer Cosmopolitan, bearing the Confederate wounded, when the
exchange was effected. Both steamers then returned, and the truce ended.</p>
